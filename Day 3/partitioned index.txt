Clustured Index (based on primary key) (created and maintained by server) 
Non-Clustured index (based on a column) (created and maintained by admins)

	
	select * from flighttable where airlines like 'jet%'
	eg. airlines	
	create index idx_flighttable_airlines
	on flighttable(airlines)
	include flightno,source,destiantion,cost


	select * from flighttable where source = 'Mumbai' and destination = 'Chennai'
		thus our index will be based on 2 columns 
		(this is called as a composite index)

	create index idx_flighttable_source_destiantion
	on flighttable(source,destianation)
	include flightno,cost,airlines


	-----------------------------------------
		select * from flighttable where airlines = 'jet airways' (need an index on airlines)
		
	select * from flighttable where source = 'Mumbai' and destination = 'Chennai'
									order by airlines
								(need index on source, destination and 									airlines)

		initital data size before index was 50MB
		after index
			1. 150MB (storage)	
			2. when airlines column goes thorough modification of data
				need to rebuild 2 airlines (in huge data(tb's of data) is an overhead
