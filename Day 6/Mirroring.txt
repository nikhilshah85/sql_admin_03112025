					Log Shipping

	1. Logs are transferred to secondary database (you can choose to sent it to multiple db's / server)
			problmes
			a. the secondary db is a read only (stand by mode)
			b. when the primary server goes down, we are safe with the data
				but projects are down as then 
			we manually have to make 2nd server as primary (which takes time)

		Thus microsoft made it possible by introducing the concept of Mirroring

		here you will need 3 instances
		1. primary (principal-active)
		2. secondary (passive-standby) 
		3. watcher (pinging servive in the background and will make secondary as primary when 1st server is down)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		Mirroring - pre-check
	1. Make sure you are connected to all the 3 instances
	2. make sure all the agents are running in a local admin account with access to interact with desktop
	3. make sure you all your servers has a common user/account which will have rights and roles, admin
		and we use the same for mirroring activities (we can use officeboy account here)
	4. create a shared folder with read/write access to the user used above (we can use everyone)
	
	5. create a sample database with table and simple data
	6. set the database in a FULL recovery mode
		create database DropshippingDB

	
		alter database DropshippingDB set recovery full

	7. we need to create an endpoint - for the agents pinging service
