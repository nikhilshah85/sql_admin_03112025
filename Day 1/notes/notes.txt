create database Banking -- success
		this will have .mdf and .ldf file

you can have a table - just structure is enough
--you will need a login to partition the data into another file

--which is a script and it will have a .ndf file, (you can also add this from the sql server explorer)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1 database can have only 1 .mdf file
optionally you can segegrate data into a separate file (which stores data only, other information like
	schema, rights, roles, etc... are still stored in the main (.mdf file)
	called as a secondary master data file (.ndf)


============================================================================
		if a transaction is fired on a row (or a row has become a part of transaction) - how should that row be dealt with from front end or other apps


	i boutght a phone and made a payment of 18, still transaction is going 
	18000 (for a phone is paid ) - balance was 60000 (so now it would be 42,000)

			if user logs from other devise when the transaction is still going on - what u want to show user 
			42k (after transaction is commited - when isolation level is set to read commited)
			60k (when isolation level is read uncommitted)
			make him/her wait

	
	at the same time, also from google pay, transferred 20k to a friend (22K) 

		what do u want to show ?
		60k (if isolation level us read uncommited - dirty read)
		42k (after transaction is commited - when isolation level is set to read commited) - applicable when repatable read is set on 
		22k (after transaction is commited - when isolation level is set to read commited) - show this when previous 1 and this 1 are commited
		make wait
		
	Serializable - highest level of isolation level 

		update employee set salary = salary * 1.1 (this will run on 20 lakh records) - when this was running, 
		lots of employee tried to check their salaries 

		till the time entire table is updated/commited it will show old data to everyone
		lets say employee no 5 and empno 18,99,001 are standing next to each other, both had salary of 10,000 (new will be 11)
		they are checking the salaries at the same time

		server started execution of query, went from 1 to 14,00,000 with no problem, but some wait to taking time after 14x which could be 3-4 mins
		or may be some time 


		if i apply for a leave of 3 days = (i had 10 available)
		it goes to manager (manager sees 10 days available) - they are viewing the snapshot copy
		I see only 7 days (only me who will see the change) - and I will not be able to further modify it, unless I cancel and release the row lock
		HR sees 10 days - they see a snapshot copy
