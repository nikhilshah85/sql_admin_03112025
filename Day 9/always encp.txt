this table can be read-write only from the front end application,after user logs in, only user can se that

as a senior dba, even I should not be to read the data

for such situation, MS came with a concept as always_encrypted,data will always stay encrypted 
	and server will decrypt and show it only to end user

 
		Types (server comes with multiple encryption algo)
			Random     - we tell server pick any random  (safest - little slow)
			Deterministic - we tell server which also to use (fastest - not that safe)
