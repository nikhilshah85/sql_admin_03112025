Mirroring  -- this is done at database level
		a.but if sever has around 10 db's, then manually configure mirroring 10 times
		b.only 1 failover, only 1 secondary - if secondary also goes down - major problem
		c.secondary cannot be used 


	Now at real, we have a feature called Always On
		you can now have multiple secondary server 
			in multiple forms
				1. Primary (Principal)
				b. 4 more instances (as stands by)
					They can be choosen as synchronous or asynchronous

			all automatic failover 

			since SQL Server 2016 you can now also have instance from cloud

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
			we need to have an additional component here for always on
			failover cluster (this is windows server service)
